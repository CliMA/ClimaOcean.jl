## Installation

To install from a Julia REPL:

```julia
julia> using Pkg

julia> Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/CliMA/ClimaOcean.jl.git")

julia> Pkg.instantiate()
```

Use `Pkg.add("url=https://github.com/CliMA/ClimaOcean.jl.git", rev="main")` to install the latest version of `ClimaOcean`.
For more information, see the [documentation for `Pkg.jl`](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org).

## Why? What's the difference between ClimaOcean and [Oceananigans](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl)?

`ClimaOcean` is for realistic global and regional ocean-only, and ocean + sea-ice models.
[Oceananigans](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl) is a lower-level package for simulation the dynamics of ocean-flavored fluids that can be used for _both_ realistic and idealized problems.
While "idealized" problems come in all shapes and sizes, "realistic" problems are more narrowly defined, and require

* Simulating the evolution of momentum, ocean temperature (or heat), salinity, and sometimes ocean biogeochemistry.
* Computing fluxes of heat, water vapor, momentum, and trace gases between the ocean and atmosphere (where the atmospheric state is either prescribed or "coupled" and itself evolving) -- and also between sea ice and the atmosphere, when a sea ice component is included.
* Initializing the ocean model with realistic bathymetry and to some known ocean state at the beginning of the simulation.
    
`ClimaOcean` uses `Oceananigans` and `ClimaSeaIce` to build `OceanSeaIceModel` capable of performing all of these tasks, and more.
Note also that, at least at the moment, `ClimaOcean`'s ocean functionality is focused on hydrostatic modeling with `Oceananigans`' `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel`.

In summary, if you're interested in realistic, hydrostatic regional or global simulations you may find `ClimaOcean` useful.
Otherwise, stick with [Oceananigans](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl).
