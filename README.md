## Installation

To install from a Julia REPL:

```julia
julia> using Pkg

julia> Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/CliMA/ClimaOcean.jl.git")

julia> Pkg.instantiate()
```

Use `Pkg.add("url=https://github.com/CliMA/ClimaOcean.jl.git", rev="main")` to install the latest version of `ClimaOcean`.
For more information, see the [documentation for `Pkg.jl`](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org).

## Why? What's the difference between ClimaOcean and [Oceananigans](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl)?

`Oceananigans` is a general-purpose library for ocean-flavored fluid dynamics. 
`ClimaOcean` implements a framework for driving realistic Oceananigans simulations with prescribed atmospheres, and coupling them to prognostic sea ice simulations.

In particular, `ClimaOcean` provides `OceanSeaIceModel` that encapsulates the ocean simulation, sea ice simulation, prescribed atmospheric state, and specifies how the three communicate.
To illustrate how `OceanSeaIceModel` works, we set up a simulation on a grid with 10 vertical levels and 1/4-degree horizontal resolution:

```julia
using Oceananigans
using Oceananigans.Units
using Dates, CFTime
import ClimaOcean

arch = GPU()
grid = LatitudeLongitudeGrid(arch,
                             size = (1440, 560, 10),
                             halo = (7, 7, 7),
                             longitude = (0, 360),
                             latitude = (-70, 70),
                             z = (-3000, 0))

bathymetry = ClimaOcean.regrid_bathymetry(grid) # builds gridded bathymetry based on ETOPO1
grid = ImmersedBoundaryGrid(grid, GridFittedBottom(bathymetry))

# Build an ocean simulation initialized to the ECCO state estimate on Jan 1, 1993
ocean = ClimaOcean.ocean_simulation(grid)
date  = DateTimeProlepticGregorian(1993, 1, 1)
set!(ocean.model, T = ClimaOcean.ECCOMetadata(:temperature; date),
                  S = ClimaOcean.ECCOMetadata(:salinity; date))

# Build and run an OceanSeaIceModel (with no sea ice component) forced by JRA55 reanalysis
atmosphere = ClimaOcean.JRA55_prescribed_atmosphere(arch)
coupled_model = ClimaOcean.OceanSeaIceModel(ocean; atmosphere)
simulation = Simulation(coupled_model, Î”t=10minutes, stop_time=30days)
run!(simulation)
```

ClimaOcean's core abstractions are `ocean_simulation` and `ClimaOcean.OceanSeaIceModel`:

* `ocean_simulation` configures an Oceananigans model for realistic simulations including temperature and salinity, the TEOS-10 equation of state, boundary conditions to store computed air-sea fluxes, the automatically-calibrated turbulence closure `CATKEVerticalDiffusivity`, and the [`WENOVectorInvariant` advection scheme](http://doi.org/10.1029/2023MS004130) for mesoscale-turbulence-resolving simulations.

* `OceanSeaIceModel` provides a framework for coupled modeling with an ocean component, prescribed atmosphere, and optionally, a sea ice component.
`OceanSeaIceModel` computes air-sea, air-ice, and ice-ocean fluxes of momentum, heat, and freshwater.

In addition to these core abstractions `ClimaOcean` provides convenience features for wrangling datasets of bathymetry, ocean temperature, salinity, ocean velocity fields, and prescribed atmospheric states.
    
`ClimaOcean` is built on top of `Oceananigans` and `ClimaSeaIce`, so it's important that `ClimaOcean` users become proficient with [`Oceananigans`](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl).
Note that `ClimaOcean` is currently focused on hydrostatic modeling with `Oceananigans`' `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel`.

The simulation above achieves approximately 8 simulated years per day of wall time on an Nvidia H100 GPU.
Since `ocean.model` is an `Oceananigans.HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel`, we can leverage all of Oceananigans features in our scripts.
For example, to plot the surface speed at the end of the simulation we write

```julia
u, v, w = ocean.model.velocities
speed = Field(sqrt(u^2 + v^2))
compute!(speed)

using GLMakie
heatmap(view(speed, :, :, ocean.model.grid.Nz), colorrange=(0, 1), nan_color=:gray)
```
