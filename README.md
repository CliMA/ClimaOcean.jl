## Installation

ClimaOcean is a registered package. To install from a Julia REPL:

```julia
julia> using Pkg

julia> Pkg.add("ClimaOcean")

julia> Pkg.instantiate()
```

Use `Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/CliMA/ClimaOcean.jl.git", rev="main")` to install the latest version of `ClimaOcean`.
For more information, see the [documentation for `Pkg.jl`](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org).

## Why? What's the difference between ClimaOcean and [Oceananigans](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl)?

Oceananigans is a general-purpose library for ocean-flavored fluid dynamics.
ClimaOcean implements a framework for driving realistic Oceananigans simulations with prescribed atmospheres, and coupling them to prognostic sea ice simulations.

### A core abstraction: `ClimaOcean.OceanSeaIceModel`

Our system for realistic modeling is anchored by `ClimaOcean.OceanSeaIceModel`, which encapsulates the ocean simulation, sea ice simulation, prescribed atmospheric state, and specifies how the three communicate.
To illustrate how `OceanSeaIceModel` works we set up a simulation on a grid with 10 vertical levels and 1/4-degree horizontal resolution:

```julia
using Oceananigans
using Oceananigans.Units
using Dates
using CUDA
import ClimaOcean

arch = GPU()
grid = LatitudeLongitudeGrid(arch,
                             size = (1440, 560, 10),
                             halo = (7, 7, 7),
                             longitude = (0, 360),
                             latitude = (-70, 70),
                             z = (-3000, 0))

bathymetry = ClimaOcean.regrid_bathymetry(grid) # builds gridded bathymetry based on ETOPO1
grid = ImmersedBoundaryGrid(grid, GridFittedBottom(bathymetry))

# Build an ocean simulation initialized to the ECCO state estimate version 2 on Jan 1, 1993
ocean = ClimaOcean.ocean_simulation(grid)
start_date = DateTime(1993, 1, 1)
set!(ocean.model,
     T=ClimaOcean.Metadatum(:temperature; date=start_date, dataset=ClimaOcean.ECCO2Daily()),
     S=ClimaOcean.Metadatum(:salinity;    date=start_date, dataset=ClimaOcean.ECCO2Daily()))

# Build and run an OceanSeaIceModel (with no sea ice component) forced by JRA55 reanalysis
atmosphere = ClimaOcean.JRA55PrescribedAtmosphere(arch)
coupled_model = ClimaOcean.OceanSeaIceModel(ocean; atmosphere)
simulation = Simulation(coupled_model, Î”t=5minutes, stop_time=30days)
run!(simulation)
```

The simulation above achieves approximately 8 simulated years per day of wall time on an Nvidia H100 GPU.

Since `ocean.model` is an `Oceananigans.HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel`, we can leverage `Oceananigans` features in our scripts.
For example, to plot the surface speed at the end of the simulation we write

```julia
u, v, w = ocean.model.velocities
speed = Field(sqrt(u^2 + v^2))
compute!(speed)

using GLMakie
heatmap(view(speed, :, :, ocean.model.grid.Nz), colorrange=(0, 0.5), colormap=:magma, nan_color=:lightgray)
```

which produces

### Additional features: a utility for `ocean_simulation`s and data wrangling

A second core abstraction in ClimaOcean is `ocean_simulation`. `ocean_simulation` configures an Oceananigans model for realistic simulations including temperature and salinity, the TEOS-10 equation of state, boundary conditions to store computed air-sea fluxes, the automatically-calibrated turbulence closure `CATKEVerticalDiffusivity`, and the [`WENOVectorInvariant` advection scheme](http://doi.org/10.1029/2023MS004130) for mesoscale-turbulence-resolving simulations.

ClimaOcean also provides convenience features for wrangling datasets of bathymetry, ocean temperature, salinity, ocean velocity fields, and prescribed atmospheric states.

ClimaOcean is built on top of Oceananigans and [ClimaSeaIce](https://github.com/CliMA/ClimaSeaIce.jl), so it's important that ClimaOcean users become proficient with [Oceananigans](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl).
Note that though ClimaOcean is currently focused on hydrostatic modeling with `Oceananigans.HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel`, realistic nonhydrostatic modeling is also within the scope of this package.
